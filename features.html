                    <p>At Eunoia, we aim to provide individually tailored, evidence-based psychological assessment and treatment for mental health difficulties in a safe and supportive atmosphere. Our approach seeks to alleviate the problems you are experiencing with the hope of creating a greater sense of wellbeing.</p>
                    <p>Psychotherapy, sometimes referred to as talk therapy, is a way to help people with mental illnesses and emotional difficulties manage and cope with their current distress. Psychotherapy can help a person function better and can increase well-being and healing.</p>
                    <p>Different types of psychotherapies exist and some types may work better with certain problems or issues. Psychotherapy may be used in combination with medication or other therapies. Therapy sessions are usually delivered in one-hour sessions and, depending on the complexity of the presenting issue, will include a comprehensive assessment using questionnaires and other tools.</p>
                    <p>Types: <br>
                        Our therapists are trained to provide the following therapies:

                        <h3>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)</h3>
                        <p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a common type of talk therapy. You will work with a mental health practitioner in a structured way, attending a limited number of sessions. CBT helps you become aware of unhelpful or negative thinking patterns so you can view challenging situations more clearly and respond to them in a more effective way.

                        <p>Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a type of psychotherapy that involves a combination of cognitive therapy and mindfulness. It builds upon the principles of cognitive therapy by using techniques such as mindfulness meditation to teach people to consciously pay attention to their thoughts and feelings without placing any judgments upon them.

Using acceptance, commitment, mindfulness skills and behaviour-change strategies, ACT’s focus is to help clients accept the realities of life and to accept thoughts for what they are.

                        <p>Dialectical means "the existence of opposites." In DBT, people are taught two seemingly opposite strategies: acceptance (i.e., that their experiences and behaviours are valid), and change (i.e., that they have to make positive changes to manage emotions and move forward). We are currently only offering individual DBT sessions.

                        <h3>Existential Therapy</h3>
                        <p>Existential therapy focuses on free will, self-determination, and the search for meaning—often centering on the client rather than on the symptom. The approach emphasizes your capacity to make rational choices and to develop to your maximum potential.

                    <p>Children and adolescents go through various developmental stages characterized by a wide variety of behaviors.  Since their behavior is constantly changing and evolving, it is often difficult to know when psychological intervention is indicated.  If behaviors become severe or impact your child’s functioning at home or in school, an evaluation can help determine what type of intervention may be helpful.</p>
                    <h2>Signs that your child may need an intervention:</h2>
                   <strong> <p>1- significant changes in eating or sleeping patterns. <br>
                       2- Irritability, sadness, or moodiness. <br>
                       3- Impaired focus or difficulty concentrating.<br>
                       4- Conflict with peers or family.<br>

                        <h3>CBT</h3>
                        <p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a common type of talk therapy. You will work with a mental health practitioner in a structured way, attending a limited number of sessions. CBT helps you become aware of unhelpful or negative thinking patterns so you can view challenging situations more clearly and respond to them in a more effective way.

                        <p>Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) is an evidence-based treatment approach shown to help children, adolescents, and their parents 
                            overcome trauma-related difficulties. TF-CBT helps children address distorted or upsetting beliefs and attributions and learn skills to help them cope with ordinary life stressors. It also helps parents who were not abusive to cope effectively with their own emotional distress and develop skills that support their children.

            <h1>d. Assessment & Reports</h1>
            <p> Eunoia clinic provides comprehensive psychological testing for both children and adults.<br>  Testing involves an initial one-hour consultation, during which time a clinical interview is conducted<br> to better determine which assessments are most appropriate to address issues of concern.<br> At the conclusion of the consultation, the examiner can estimate how many hours will be needed <br>for formal testing, scoring of test measures, and writing the report. <br>Fees for assessments can vary,<br> depending on the purpose of the assessment and the presenting problem,<br> and are determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>
            <p>The types of available assessments  include:<br></p>
            <p><strong>Psychological Testing</strong></p>
            <p>Psychological testing focuses on cognitive, emotional, and psychological factors that may impact a person’s life.<br> Psychological testing is conducted to look at emotional disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety,<br> stress, suicide potential, schizophrenia, and other mental health disorders. <br>Testing is often done to formalize diagnoses as well as to obtain a comprehensive picture <br>of an individual in order to assist in devising a treatment plan.</p>
            <p><strong>Psychoeducational Testing/strong></p></strong>
            <p>Psychoeducational testing is often performed to determine whether a child or an adult has a learning disability<br> or an attention problem (e.g., ADHD) that is interfering with performance at school or the workplace.<br> Psychoeducational testing usually involves administration of a test of intellectual ability and an achievement test.<br> In the case of children testing often includes questionnaires to be completed by teachers or family members.<br> This testing often includes administration of an IQ test <br>which provides a comprehensive assessment of cognitive strengths and weaknesses.</p>
            <p><strong>Neuropsychological Testing</p></strong>
            <p>Neuropsychological evaluations are typically conducted for individuals having difficulty in learning, attention,<br> behavior, socialization, or emotional control, as well as for those suffering from developmental problems<br> that affect brain function or from an injury to the brain. Specifically, this testing provides a better understanding<br> of a person’s functioning in areas such as memory, attention, perception, coordination, language, and personality.</p>
